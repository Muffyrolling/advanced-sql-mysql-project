📌 Key Skills Practiced
•	**Advanced SQL Queries**: Complex aggregations, filtering with `CASE WHEN`, time-based grouping (monthly, weekly, hourly).
•	**Conversion Funnel Analysis**: Built multi-step user funnels using session and pageview data.
•	**Channel & Device Comparison**: Evaluated traffic sources (gsearch, bsearch, etc.) and device performance.
•	**Customer Behavior Tracking**: Identified new vs. returning users, repeat purchases, and engagement patterns.
•	**Refund & Product Analysis**: Measured refund rates by product, tracked product quality issues.
•	**Cross-Selling Impact**: Analyzed before/after trends of cross-sell promotions on AOV and order volume.
•	**SQL Best Practices**: Used subqueries, CTEs, temporary tables, and optimized JOINs for scalable analysis.
•	**Business-Oriented Insights**: All queries were tied to real-world KPIs and decision-making scenarios.
